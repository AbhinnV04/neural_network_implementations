# Neural Network Architectures

Welcome to the **Neural Network Architectures** repository! This repository is dedicated to the implementation and exploration of various neural network architectures. The goal is to recreate well-known neural network models from scratch, providing a detailed understanding and hands-on experience.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this repository are:

1. **Implementation:** Creating modular and understandable implementations of popular neural network architectures.
2. **Learning:** Deepening understanding and gaining practical experience in building neural network models.

## Neural Network Architectures

The repository includes implementations of several renowned neural network architectures, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet, and more. Each architecture is implemented in a clear and modular manner.

## Getting Started
1. Explore the Implementations:
<br>
Navigate to each architecture's directory (e.g., lenet5/, alexnet/) to find the implementation details.
<br>
2. Understand the Code:
<br>
Dive into the source code of each implementation to grasp the architecture and its components.
