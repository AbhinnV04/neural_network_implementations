# Neural Network Implementations

Welcome to the **Neural Network Implementations** repository! This repository is dedicated to the implementation and exploration of various neural network architectures using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to recreate and work with popular neural network models, comparing their performances on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this repository are:

1. **Implementation and Comparison:** Implementing well-known neural network architectures from scratch to deepen understanding and gain hands-on experience.
2. **Performance Evaluation:** Comparing the performance of different architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset, understanding their strengths and weaknesses in the context of this specific task.

## Neural Network Architectures

The repository includes implementations of several popular neural network architectures, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet, and more. Each architecture is implemented in a modular and understandable manner.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training and evaluation. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is conveniently available through the Keras library.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural_network_implementations.git
   cd neural_network_implementations
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Implementations:**
   - Navigate to each architecture's directory (e.g., `lenet5/`, `alexnet/`) to find the implementation details and training scripts.

4. **Train and Evaluate Models:**
   - Follow the instructions in each architecture's directory to train and evaluate the models.
